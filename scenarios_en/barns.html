<h3>Barns</h3>

<p>Suzy looks out the window of her car and sees a barn near the road, and so she comes to believe that there’s a barn near the road. However, Suzy doesn’t realize that the countryside she is driving through is currently being used as the set of a film, and that the set designers have constructed many fake barn facades in this area that look as though they are real barns. In fact, Suzy is looking at the only real barn in the area.</p>

<p><strong> Does Suzy really know that there is a barn next to the road she is driving along?
<!--Zuza wie, że przy drodze, którą jedzie, jest stodoła?--></strong></p>
