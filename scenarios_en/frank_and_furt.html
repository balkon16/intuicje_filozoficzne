<h3>Frank and Furt</h3>

<p>Frank has reasons to harm Furt and makes the choice to shoot him on his own, moved by those reasons. Unbeknownst to Frank, a neuroscientist has been secretly monitoring his brain processes. Had the neuroscientist had any reason to believe that Frank wasn’t going to make the choice on his own (the neuroscientist is a reliable predictor of those things), he would have intervened by manipulating Frank’s brain in such a way that Frank would still have made the same choice.</p>
