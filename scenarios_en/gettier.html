<h3>American car</h3>

<p>Bob has a friend, Jill, who has driven a Buick for many years.
Bob therefore thinks that Jill drives an American car. He is not
aware, however, that her Buick has recently been stolen, and he
is also not aware that Jill has replaced it with a Pontiac, which
is a different kind of American car.</p>

<p>
    <strong>
Does Bob really know that Jill drives an American car, or does he only believe it?
