<h3>
Incompleteness theorem
</h3>

<p>
Suppose that John has learned in college that Gödel is the man who proved
an important mathematical theorem, called the incompleteness of
arithmetic. John is quite good at mathematics and he can give an accurate
statement of the incompleteness theorem, which he attributes to Gödel as
the discoverer. But this is the only thing that he has heard about Gödel.
Now suppose that Gödel was not the author of this theorem. A man called
“Schmidt” whose body was found in Vienna under mysterious
circumstances many years ago, actually did the work in question. His
friend Gödel somehow got hold of the manuscript and claimed credit for
the work, which was thereafter attributed to Gödel. Thus he has been
known as the man who proved the incompleteness of arithmetic. Most
people who have heard the name ‘Gödel’ are like John; the claim that
Gödel discovered the incompleteness theorem is the only thing they have
ever heard about Gödel.
