<h3>
John-thermometer
</h3>


<p>
One day John is suddenly knocked out by a team of well–meaning scientists sent
by the elders of his community, and his brain is re–wired so that he is always
absolutely right whenever he estimates the temperature where he is. John is
completely unaware that his brain has been altered in this way. A few weeks later,
this brain re–wiring leads him to believe that it is 71 degrees in his room. Apart
from his estimation, he has no other reasons to think that it is 71 degrees. In fact,
it is at that time 71 degrees in his room.

Does John really know thta it was 71 degrees in the room?
<!-- oryginalne pytanie: Does John really know that it was 71 degrees in the room, or does he only believe it? -->
<!-- John wie, że w jego pokoju jest 21 stopni Celsjusza? -->
