<h3>Teleportation</h3>

<p>The year is 2450 and human civilization has advanced so far that we could barely comprehend it. Derek is currently on Earth. His wife is on Venus. His mother is on Mars. Feeling somewhat lonely, Derek enters the Quantum Teletransporter in his house on Earth and says, “I want to visit my wife and I want to visit my mother.” Then he presses the button. In an instant, the quantum device scans his body and records the exact state of all his cells and brain states. Instantly, the information travels through an information wormhole to Venus and also to Mars, where it is perfectly reconstituted in physical form.
Instantly, a figure steps out of the Teletransporter in Derek’s wife’s apartment on Venus. With a smile, they hug and she says, “My dear! I’m so happy to see you!” Simultaneously a figure steps out of the Teletransporter in Derek’s mother’s apartment on Mars. With a smile, they hug and she says, “My dear! I’m so happy to see you!”. Derek’s house on Earth is now empty.
