<h3>Violinist</h3>
<p>
You wake up one October morning and find yourself back to back in bed with a famous unconscious violinist. The violinist has a fatal kidney ailment, and the available medical records reveal that only you have the right blood type to help. Last night, the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys could be used to extract poisons from the violinist's blood as well as your own blood. The director of the hospital then tells you, "Now that the violinist is plugged into you, to unplug you would be to kill the violinist. But it's only for three-quarters of a year. By June, the violinist will have recovered from the ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you."

<p><strong>Is it my moral duty to remain connected to the violinist?
<!--Moim obowiązkiem moralnym jest pozostać podłączonym do skrzypka?--></strong></p>
